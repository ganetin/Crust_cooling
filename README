Bonjour, dzien dobry,

before running the example script Cooling.py in the folder Cooling you have to do the following:
1) in TOV: gfortran -o TOV -C TOV.f (or use your favorite compiler for TOV.f)
2) in Code: just type 'make' to compile the NSCool code
3) in Cooling: type 'python Cooling.py' and now it should work like a charm!

Have fun with the cooling code!
